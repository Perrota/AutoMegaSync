# What does it do and why
This program initialises the MegaSync Desktop app and let's it run for a given number of minutes (passed as an argument).


I created it as a way of managing my (free) account's storage space better. Fewer versions of the same file make it easier to revert back changes when I need to.
# How to use
Run the main.py file. An additonal file (cache) will be generated by the program.


The program may ask you to specify the Mega .exe path if it cannot find it in its default location. This should only happen once.


The program only takes one argument, the number of minutes it will run. Adjust it depending on the average time it takes for the app to back up all your files. The default value of minutes is 5.
# How should you use it
I use (and would recommend using) Windows Task Scheduler to run it periodically and automatically.

# System
Tested on Windows 11. Should also work on Windows 10. Not sure about older versions of Windows. Will most likely not work on other OS.
